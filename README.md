This repository contains the projects completed during the Intro-to-programming-Nanodegree offered by Udacity. The Nanodegree consists of three projects:

## Project 1: Animal Trading Card

### Description
The Animal Trading Card project is a visually appealing website showcasing an animal card for a turtle. Created using HTML and CSS, the design is focused on providing a beautiful representation of the turtle, offering a glimpse into the basics of front-end web development.

## Project 2: Pixel Art Maker

### Description
The Pixel Art Maker project is an interactive website built with JavaScript. Users can specify an "n * n" grid and receive a canvas of pixels. The grid allows users to color each pixel with their chosen color or erase it, fostering creativity and demonstrating foundational concepts in JavaScript for dynamic web applications.

## Project 3: Adventure Text Game

### Description
The Adventure Text Game is a Python-based interactive game where users make choices that influence the outcome of the story. Leveraging the random library, each playthrough starts with a different set of conditions, ensuring a unique experience each time. The use of `time.sleep` adds a dynamic touch to the storytelling, allowing text to reveal gradually, creating an immersive experience.
